# Fastmail in Sidebar
## Notice: this addon is ***NOT*** currently published at addons.mozilla.org
A Firefox WebExtension to display [Fastmail](https://Fastmail.com/) in the sidebar.

This extension adds a new section to the Firefox sidebar which contains the Fastmail website.

Press `Alt+Shift+F` to open. This shortcut can be changed by going to Add-ons -> Fastmail in Sidebar -> Options.

## Disclaimer

This Add-on is primarily for personal use; a personal project if you will. I'm just trying to use Fastmail on the Firefox sidebar. This add-on just launches their website in the sidebar. This extension is an independent project, has no relationship, and is not affiliated to Fastmail in any way.
